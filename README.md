Pyclid is a simple python script that calculates the highest common factor between two numbers.


## Installation

To use the python script simply use the below commands. Note: You will need to install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sampoder/Pyclid.git

cd Pyclid

python main.py
```

## Upcoming Updates

In the coming week, I hope to convert Pyclid into a full python library.
